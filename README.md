# cmu-summer-school-2020

This repository will hold my project for the [Simon Initiative LearnLab Summer School], 2020, held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This project involves a binary operator learner. Given one base 10 number, the binary operator and the output, the [Apprentice Learner] will have to determine was the missing number is.
